<p>Using Pandas + Plotly + SQLite to show a full stack use case of Time Series Data.</p>
<p>Analyze spending over time per person (could be adapted to categories / tags / etc).</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://github.com/gerardrbentley/roommate-ledger">Github Repo</a></p>
<h2 id="idea">Idea<a class="headerlink" href="#idea" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>One time series that any financially independent person should pay attention to is their spending over time.</p>
<p>Tracking your spending gets complicated with roommates and budgets for different categories.
It also complicates your understanding of your data with a glance, which is where charts and graphs can help.</p>
<p>There are many personal budgeting and even group budgeting apps, but I wanted to make the simplest possible and stick to the Data and Visualizations as an MVP.</p>
<p>One way to get this data is from a CSV export from a bank account or credit card company.
In <a href="{% post_url 2022-03-11-timeseries-part-3 %}">Part 3</a> is an app that uses this method on general time series data.
Upload a CSV with some column for time stamps and some column to forecast and tune your own prediction model!</p>
<p>The main drawbacks to this paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't share data between people / sessions</li>
<li>Can't persist data</li>
<li>Can't incrementally add data</li>
<li>Can't update data</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way is the CRUD paradigm explored in my <a href="{% post_url 2022-02-10-streamlit-fullstack %}">Streamlit Full Stack Post</a>.
With this method we'll be able to operate on individual data points and let our friends / roommates add to it!</p>
<p>(Of course the CSV paradigm could be blended with this)</p>
<p>Now for each aspect of the app, from Backend to Front</p>
<h2 id="devops">DevOps<a class="headerlink" href="#devops" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>There's not much real DataOps in this project since the data is self-contained.</p>
<p>That said, there are some DevOps aspects that are important in the time series world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment: having a webserver accessible to multiple users</li>
<li>Integration: how to get updated code into the deployment(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaning on Streamlit Cloud sharing checks both of these boxes with ease.</p>
<p>By including a <code>requirements.txt</code> and specifying a python version for the image, we get a free CI/CD pipeline from any push to a github branch (more providers to come).
It'll provide us with an Ubuntu-like container that installs all requirements and tries to perform <code>streamlit run streamlit_app.py</code>, yielding a live webserver accessible to the public for public repos!</p>
<h2 id="backend">Backend<a class="headerlink" href="#backend" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The Data Engineering aspect involves a bit of data design and a bit of service writing.</p>
<p>I decided the minimum data to track expenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>purchased_date</code></li>
<li>The day on which the purchase was made</li>
<li><code>purchased_by</code></li>
<li>The name of the person who made the purchase</li>
<li><code>price_in_cents</code></li>
<li>Price of the purchase. Tracked in cents to avoid <a href="https://www.lahey.com/float.htm">floating point perils</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Relying on SQLite, we'll have to represent the date as a string, but <code>pandas</code> will help us transform it to a date / datetime object.
A table creation routine with SQLite for this might look like:</p>

<p>That's all well and good for a DBA, but what about the Python glue?</p>
<p>Using <code>pydantic</code> / <code>dataclasses</code> is my preferred way to make Python classes that represent database objects or API responses.
Splitting the Model into a child class for the internal application usage and parent class for database syncing is one way to handle auto-created id's and optional vs. required arguments.</p>

<p>200 times we'll create and save an Expense object with a hardcoded id and some random values for date, purchaser, and price.
(Note the randomized days max out at 28 to avoid headaches with february being short. There's probably a builtin to help with random days, maybe just timedelta with random amount is easier)</p>
<p>Using <code>kwarg</code> placeholders of the form <code>:keyname</code> lets us pass the dictionary / JSON representation of our Python object instead of specifying each invidual field in the correct order.</p>
<p>The rest of the CRUD operations follow a similar pattern.
Reading is the only hacky function to allow filtering / querying at database level before pulling <strong>ALL</strong> records into memory.</p>
<h2 id="reshaping-the-data">Reshaping the Data<a class="headerlink" href="#reshaping-the-data" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The Data Science aspect of this involves massaging the data into something useful to display.</p>
<p>The data as it stands is not actually the well formed time series you might have thought.</p>
<p>Sure the date stamps are all real, but what value do we read from them?
The goal is to track spending (<code>price_in_cents</code> in the database).</p>
<p>But what if we have multiple purchases on the same day?
Then we might start treating all the purchases on a given day as stochastic samples and that is not our use case. (But that might fit your use case if you are trying to model behaviour based off of <strong>many</strong> people's purchases)</p>
<h3 id="enter-the-pandas">Enter the Pandas<a class="headerlink" href="#enter-the-pandas" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Utilizing Pydantic to parse / validate our database data then dumping as a list of dictionaries for Pandas to handle gets us a dataframe with all the expenses we want to see.
Passing a <code>start_date</code>, <code>end_date</code>, and <code>selections</code> will limit the data to certain time range and <code>purchased_by</code> users.</p>

<p>Side note:
I also added a feature where "All" is a valid selection in addition to all <code>purchased_by</code> users.</p>
<p>The "All" spending per day is the sum of each row!</p>
<p>(We can sanity check this by checking for rows with 2 non-zero values and sum those up to check the All column)</p>

<p>To fill in date gaps (make the time series have a well defined period of one day), one way is to build your own range of dates and then reindex the time series dataframe with the full range of dates.</p>
<p>Grabbing the min and max of the current index gets the start and end points for the range.
Filling with 0 is fine by me since there were no purchases on those days</p>

<p>In this case let's get the cumulative spending per 7 days per person.</p>
<p>Notice that the value will stay the same on days when the person made <code>$0.00</code> of purchases, since <code>x + 0 = x</code>!</p>

<p>Seems like it's undoing a lot of work we've already done, but this Long Format is generally easier for plotting software to work with.</p>
<p>In this case we keep <code>purchased_date</code> as a column (not index), get a value column called <code>value</code>, and a column we can use for trend highlighting which is <code>purchased_by</code></p>
<p>After that, plotly express provides the easiest (but not most performant) visualizations in my experience</p>
