# LightGBM Predicting Water Pump Functionality



Water Pump functionality prediction. Based on the DrivenData challenge [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/)

See the exploration in [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/gerardrbentley/pump-it-up/main) üéà

For better performance, grab the code from [github repo](https://github.com/gerardrbentley/pump-it-up)

## Project Walkthrough

Using data from [Taarifa](http://taarifa.org/) and the [Tanzanian Ministry of Water](http://maji.go.tz/), can we predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all?

Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed.

A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

### Data Sources

### Feature Exploration and Engineering

Much of this was guided by the DrivenData Competition forum, specifically this user's [EDA + Catboost example](https://towardsdatascience.com/pump-it-up-with-catboost-828bf9eaac68) (I haven't tried out all of his data processing steps... yet)
