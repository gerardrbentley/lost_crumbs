# Domain Name


Most custom domain (website) names goes for around $12 USD per year, but students can get 3(!) free domains with [The Github dev pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (highly recommended if you're eligible). 
I use [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) for this domain ([gerardbentley.com]()) mostly because I trust they won't have any hidden fees, won't leak my credit card info, and will be reliable.
Feel free to use [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/) or any other domain name service you prefer.
Custom domains are limited to one owner, so don't be disappointed if someone else got what you wanted first (capitalism!).
