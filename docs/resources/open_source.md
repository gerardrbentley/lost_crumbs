# Open Source


Open Source Software refers to applications / libraries / frameworks whose design and code is publicly available, which allows users to modify and share updated versions.

Opposite of "proprietary" software, which a company sells to you and does not allow you to modify or usually even inspect.

Generally trustworthy because of transparency, but don't click on random links / downloads / scripts.

## Contributing

Open Source projects rely on contributors (from 1 to many) to write, bugtest, fix, and document code.

## Paid Open Source

Some Projects also rely on funding from users / sponsors. 

This includes
- One Time Donors 
- Patronage: donating on a schedule
- Hosted / Paid Services: Providing support for the product or providing computing resources that are already running the product.
